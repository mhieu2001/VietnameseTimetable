# Data 
The Vietnam Time Use Survey project in 2022 was implemented to support the World Bank on collecting gender disaggregated data to monitor gender gaps:
(a) Contribute to the gender disaggregated time use data in Vietnam
(b) Provide indicators that measure the burden imposed by and differences time spent in unpaid houseworks, such as household chores, taking care of elders and children, in genders, urbanicity, ethnicities.

To reach these objectives, the project interviewed 6,000 respondents across 6 socio-economic regions of Vietnam, covering all kinds of ethnicities, occupations and income levels.
